Dear Colleagues,

See the homework below. Feel free to contact me for any clarifications
 
* Modify platform_test.c driver to support data transfer in both directions from /dev/mem to kernel (already supported) and from kernel to /dev/mem. 

* This implies creation of extra memory regions for data buffer, counter and synchronization flags as well as delayed WQ that will send some data(i.e. value of jiffies) to the data buffer with some periodic intervals.

* Develop testing application (similar to send_data) that will read the data from /dev/mem

BBB: To reserve DRAM region at the end of 512M space:
Go to U-boot prompt and modify NFS boot variable
=> editenv netargs
(add mem=500M at the end of netargs value)
=> saveenv
